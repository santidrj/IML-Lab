"""
- Modify the distance metric in the k-IBl so that it used preprocess features weights
- We may choose 2 algorithms (filter or wrapper)
- the selection will be computed in the training set, as preprocessing step.
- some examplesReliefF, Information Gain, or the Correlation

- analyze the results of selectionkIBLAlgorithm vs kIBLAlgorithm
    - set both algorithm with the best combination and evaluate the classification accuracy
